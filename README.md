## Welcome to LoL Bot
- This is a python bot that uses the local League Client API to start games and plays them with a simple but effective game loop.
- This bot has leveled up [thousands of league accounts](https://www.playerauctions.com/lol-account/) and is still going strong.
- No pixel botting and/or image recognition makes it easy to run on any setup.

## Current Features
- Start League and Login
- Start a Bot Game

- End game, earn experience, collect rewards
- Loop ðŸ¥¡ðŸ§‹


## Requirements
- [Python >= 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [League of Legends](https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/signup/download)
- [League of Legends Account](https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/signup/index)

## Setup
- Ensure Python is added to your PATH, check "Add Python to PATH" when [installing](https://youtu.be/nU2Egc3Zx3Q)
- Clone the repo
- In command prompt, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- In some cases, it may be necessary to download and install [Microsoft C and C++ (MSVC) runtime libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

## Optional Configuration
For Virtual Machine setups, I recommend starting with [this forum](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/league-of-legends/480977-run-league-legends-virtual-machine-vmware.html). *Note:* I will not be fixing/troubleshooting VM related issues as there are far too many VM implementation/platform specific issues

The League of Legends accounts should already have accepted the riot promise, set a username, and skipped the tutorials. The bot will automatically change your league settings/configuration and the game window (not the client) should open as a 1024x768 window

*Note:* v2.0.0+ has a gui and will not display a terminal window as shown in the gif. The gif is based on a sub 2.0.0 version
